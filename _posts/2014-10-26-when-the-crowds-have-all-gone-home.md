####When the Crowds Have all Gone Home

Let me just tell you that playing shows is kind of the greatest. It's like having a birthday party where you get all the attention you could ever want. Everyone tells you that you look good, and everything you say is (all of a sudden) funny. People take your picture, and sometimes act like you're really important because youre standing on a stage. 

But after a show is over, this is what happens--at least for me. The applause dies out, I say my thank-yous, smile for photos, and laugh with some strangers. 

I pack my car, and respond to the Instagram comments. I write my "thank you" tweet, tag the Facebook photos, wash off the makeup, put on mismatching pajamas, the sit on the couch with a plate of whatever I can find in the fridge. My roommates fall asleep and I am alone. No one left to impresss, no one left to prove myself to. 

######Silence. 

Silence is that friend that always tells the rude truth. I politely avoid her whenever possible. Silence is like a big wave that carries away all the noise and leaves me alone on the shore with all the garbage and broken seashells that are *me*. 

When I'm silent, I'm forced to look at myself. I can't hide behind makeup and trendy clothes and 140 witty characters. Silence brings me into a room of mirrors. I have no choice but to see myself--and from all the unflattering angles.

This year, I've spent a lot of time in silence, and not really by my choice. Something I realized is this: I had been so well-known by everyone except myself. I really liked the girl in the photos, and I liked the girl on the stage, and I liked the girl on Instagram, but the girl on the couch with leftovers? Not her.

Sure, it feels safer to duck behind iPhone screens or small talk or anything else we use to appear confident. But isn't it exhausting? Surely, we weren't made for that. We are not all we wish to be--and we aren't everything people think we are. Some of us have even fooled our selves. 

But silence crashes the party and ruins the costumes. If you don't like yourself when you're alone and silent, you don't like yourself at all. I learned this year to make peace with the *me* that sits alone in silence, because that's the real one. 

And when I learned to like myself, I found that I was free to love others without comparing. I was able to forgive myself for my shortcomings, and I am learning to believe that there are people that can deeply love me in spite of them. As I have learned to know myself and like myself, it seems like the sky is bigger, and I am free to create with joy instead of fear. 

I want all of that for you too. If you're afraid of silence like I am, there is a reason. But there are surely great things on the other side of it. Silence is a rude friend, but a true one.

"I'm going home with the wind," I thought. For my mind was spinning, and the lines on my face burrowed deeper each night as I turned. Things twisted in me like moles underground--leaving dirt scars on the grass.

So I drove home, and I marched up to the tall brick house sitting behind the trees. And Jane opened the door. Seventeen and sparky, she brought me into her neon bedroom and invited me to talk.

I had imagined that she'd have simple answers to my weary questions. I used to think that the former me was wiser, calmer, more controlled. But as I told her my story, it reflected off the naivety in her face. I thought she'd have something profound to say, but she said nothing. My words flew straight through her like a ghost. She didn't get it. She hadn't even left home yet.

But I felt like pieces of me were scattered about like highway litter. The things I knew and the things I wanted to believe refused to come together. The things that I desired and the things that I feared were in violent war. And so far, my time as a young adult had gifted me with a wild heart scorched by disappointment.

I used to remember the former me, the woundless and innocent. I used to wish that I could return to her. But in all of this, I have realized something important. Back then, I was more sure of myself, but I certainly was not wiser. Although the 17 year-old version of me was chipper and confident, she hadn't faced the things that I have now faced. 

For her heart had never yet been broken into. She hadn't yet been manipulated; she hadn't mistaken passion for love. She hadn't yet broken any promises. She had not been taught to fear. She had not yet learned to saw off friendships before they became unsafe. She hadn't believed that God had betrayed her. She had not yet cradled the lies she thought would save her. She had not yet fallen asleep next to ignored prayers and tragedy.

I used to think that to find rest and healing, I had to go backwards. But I see now that I must move on. I cannot go back to restart before all of the mistakes, nor can I skip over the consequences to start there.

**I can only start from here.**

Most of us have known a time when all our investments have derailed; when we are a heap of laundry soaked in tears; and when we are ashamed to find that we don't know all that we thought we would by now. In a time like that, 

The hurting person will say, "This is not how things are supposed to be."
 
And the strong person continues, "But this is the way things are." 

Then the brave person says, "We can only start from here." 

And the unwavering one says, **"So we will."**

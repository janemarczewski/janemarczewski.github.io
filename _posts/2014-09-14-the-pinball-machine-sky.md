We sat under the stars on a country road, the four of us. On our way home from watching the sun set on mountain cliffs, we stopped on the side of the road to stare into the stars we so rarely get to see.

After a couple of well-meaning cars stopped to see if we were okay, the road quieted, and we gazed up at hundreds of stars. They reflected in our eyes as we listened to crickets and birds, and to the tiny crunching road stones under our backs when we moved. 

We laid there and talked about nonsense—like how the flashes of airplanes were actually aliens trying to take photos of us. Or how many fairies were flittering through the field next to us. And Emily spoke dreamily about the morning she stared into her sink and realized, “wow, someone made that.” Then we *mmm, yeah-ed* for a second like a bunch of stoners, then erupted into eye-squeezing belly laughter. 

And while we yammered on about everything and nothing, the four of us saw the shooting star of the century. Broader than any other star in the sky, we saw a blazing white streak tumble down through the pinball machine sky. It whirled down until it disappeared, but seconds after it was gone, the smoke trail behind it was still lit up in its honor.

We cheered and hooted and high fived like we had won the World Cup of star-watching. I mean, we basically did win the World Cup of star-watching. We laid back again, the four of us exhaling and still smiling wide. The crickets and the birds started again. 

“Do shooting stars like that happen every night, you think?” I said breathily.

“Yeah, even in New York City. You can stare into the sky in New York City, and not see a thing. But that doesn’t mean they’re not there. There is just too much other light,” someone answered. 

I guess there are shooting stars all over the sky--even in the daytime. But the only ones who see them are the ones looking. And just like that, God is near. God is speaking, God is close, God is giving grace. He has so many good things to give, but we are not always looking.

And you know, sometimes even when we are looking and listening, we still can’t see Him. But if we can’t see him, let it not be because we were distracted. And if we can’t hear him, let it not be because we didn't turn off the other noises. 

There (literally) are shooting stars in the sky above your house today.

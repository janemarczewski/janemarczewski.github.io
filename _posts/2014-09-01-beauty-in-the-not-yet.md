There is a beauty that intimidates, a beauty that makes us painfully aware of how far we have fallen short. It silences us by the terrible distance between who we are and who we wish to be. This is the designer-home, long-legged-supermodel type of beauty.

Then there is a beauty that invites, a beauty that welcomes and nurtures—the kind of beauty in finger paintings and in the wrinkles around our mothers’ eyes. And that kind of beauty is better. That kind of beauty reassures us that in all our imperfections, we have something sacred and meaningful on our hands. It convinces us that our life stories are worth writing and maybe worth hearing.

All the things we wish were different, all the things that are disproportioned, the things that are out of order and not yet restored, the freckles, the rust, the fog, the tears, and the cracks in the ceiling—all are beautiful. For we are not yet everything that we will become.

For the mountains are both behind and before us. We have conquered and we will conquer. We have fought, and we will fight. We have hurt, and we will hurt. We have doubted, and we will doubt. We have lost, and we will again lose. We have loved, and we will remain in love. We have adventured, and we will venture on.

Let’s be the kind of people that give reason to believe that although we have not arrived, there is beauty in the here and now. The kind of beauty that redeems the disappointment, the kind of beauty that comforts, the kind of beauty that says although we are not yet everything we will become, there is beauty in the journey, in the fight. 

There is beauty in the not-yet.

> Ecclesiastes 3:11 “[God] has made everything beautiful in its time.”

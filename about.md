Hi, my name's Jane Marczewski. I'm a singer and a songwriter, and have been one for as long as I can remember.

I grew up in Ohio in the middle of a family of overachievers. When I was young, I took a lot of music lessons where I learned how to play guitar and piano, also how not to cry every time I had an audience.

I had been a closet songwriter for a really long time, but when I was about twenty years old, I started playing them for people. There's nothing like the feeling when I realized my songs could mean something to more people than just me.

Writing and sharing music is what I love to do the most, and I hope to make a life out of it. You can get all of my music for free right here. I hope you like it.

Thanks for being here.

Jane

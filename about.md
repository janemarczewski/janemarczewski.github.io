I'm Jane. I'm a singer/songwriter, and have been one for as long as I can remember. But it's only been a couple years since I started calling myself that.

During the first 18 years of my life, I became a master at the art of keeping everyone happy. I became really good at altering myself to be what people preferred, what they expected. I got good grades, sang at church, kept my room clean, made my family proud. I was safe, predictable, composed.

When I was about half through college, a lot of things changed. I found myself living in an inner-city rental house with termites and chipping lead paint. However, I remember it more like a castle with breathing golden windows. And the me who moved in was very different from the me who moved out.

During my time there, I found myself inspired by the people around me--inspired by strangers and rain and front doors. I was brought to life by friends who listened as I became courageous enough to share my songs. I fell in love with a sneaker-wearing boy who had a smile like the sky. (The end of our relationship inspired many of the songs on [Ocean&Sky](http://www.noisetrade.com/janemarczewski/oceansky).) He and my friends told me that I had something special. They told me that my songs mattered, and I started to believe them.

And slowly, the vacuum-sealed and sterile version of me was seared open. I looked myself in the eyes with honesty--maybe for the first time--and found that at the heart of me, I wanted to sing. The following year, opportunities flooded through my windows and doors, and through my computer screen. I pursued some of them, and here I am.

When you're a twenty-something, a lot of people start asking, _"What are you going to do with your life?"_ I've had too many existential crises trying to write a good answer. So here's the real one: I guess I'm just trying to sing. Because I love to.

Writing and sharing music makes me come alive. It sweeps me away with the romance of purpose. It teaches me to breathe, it reveals the truth about the condition of my heart, and it gives me an avenue to tell stories that deserve ears.

Let me tell you, it's okay to have a messy answer to the question, _"What are you doing with your life?"_ Just find your castle with breathing windows. Find the things that sear open the vacuum-sealed version of you. Be brave enough to look yourself in the eyes and be honest with yourself about who you are made to be.

So that's that.
